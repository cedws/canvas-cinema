# canvas-cinema
A recreation of a HTML5 experiment I wrote years ago and lost. The idea was to have an in-browser multiplayer world with YouTube embeds as cinema screens. I still think it's a pretty cool idea but I don't have the plentiful time required to execute it well. Physics are entirely driven by the backend which is pretty inefficient. Also, it's possible to spoof as another player. It's just a little proof of concept.
